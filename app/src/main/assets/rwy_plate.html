        <H2>WairToNow Runway Diagram Plates</H2>

        <P>The plates are synthesized by WairToNow based on runway lat/lon
            information provided by the FAA.  The information for some
            airports is incomplete so all runways may not be present on
            some diagrams.  The diagrams are backed by tiles from
            <A HREF="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</A>
            appropriate to the size of the device's screen, which usually
            contain runway and taxiway outlines as well as nearby streets.
            WairToNow will draw runway numbers where the FAA has provided
            runway numbers and navaid markers for on-airport navaids.</P>

        <P><FONT COLOR=RED>Note:  The OpenStretMap tiles may be out-of-date
            and thus the diagram will not show recent runway and taxiway
            changes, <I>so use extra caution</I>.</FONT></P>

        <P>All airports will have a RWY-RUNWAY DIAGRAM button shown on their
            <A HREF="p_waypt.html">Waypt</A> page, regardless of whether the
            corresponding <A HREF="p_maint.html#plate">plate download</A>
            has been done for the state the airport is in or not.   The
            difference is that downloading the plate information will
            pre-fetch the OpenStreetMap tiles backing the runway diagram.
            If the tiles have not been pre-fetched, WairToNow will attempt
            to fetch them at the time of display which requires Internet
            access.  WairToNow will also try to use zoomed-out tiles covering
            the area if available.  If no tiles are available, the diagram
            will appear with a black background.</P>

        <P>WairToNow will use the latest GPS position received to position
            the airplane on the plate if the position is within the runway
            diagram to aid in taxiing when there is no FAA-provided Airport
            Diagram page available.</P>
