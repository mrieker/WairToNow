        <H2>Waypt1 and Waypt2 Pages</H2>
        <P>These pages are used to view information related to database-defined waypoints.
            They consist of airports, fixes, localizers and navaids.  Each page is
            independent (like NAV1/NAV2 radios) and can be used to select different
            waypoints.  The history list is common to both however, so Waypt2 can be used
            to select something that was in Waypt1 a while ago and vice versa.</P>

        <P>NOTE:  If you click the Waypt1 or Waypt2 button and see a diagram or plate (secondary
            page), click the same button again to get back to the waypoint selection page (primary
            page).</P>

                                    description contains all the words given in the search box.
                                <LI>The search is case-insensitive.
                                <LI>Only letters and numbers are searched, all other characters are
                                    treated as spaces separating words.

                                    partials.

                                    databases are enabled on the

                                    when searching for a particular waypoint, you may get duplicates
                                    if there is more than one database currently enabled.  You must
                                    then choose which one you want from the presented menu.
                            </UL>
                        <LI>You may also click one of the history buttons listed below the text box
                            to get a recent waypoint.  Long-click the button to delete it from the list.
                        <LI>The <B>GoTo</B> button will set the waypoint as the current destination
                            and a line will be drawn from the airplane to the destination location
                            on the <B><A HREF="p_chart.html">Chart</A></B> page.
                        <LI>The <B>Locate</B> button will center the moving map of the
                            <B><A HREF="p_chart.html">Chart</A></B> page on the waypoint.  If the
                            screen goes black, it just means the waypoint is not on the current
                            chart, so you must click the <B>Chart</B> button to select a different
                            chart.
                        <LI>The <B>RNAV</B> button will allow entry of an RNAV-like offset from the
                            current waypoint to create a new waypoint.
                        <LI>Description information for the waypoint will be displayed next.
