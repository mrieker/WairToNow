        <H2>Sensors Page</H2>
        <P>This page is used to select which sensors the app uses to tell what is happening in the
            area.  There are four main sources to select from:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI><B>Internal GPS</B> - enables using the Android device's internal GPS receiver to
                determine position information.<BR>
                <IMG SRC="sensors-internal-qtr.png"></LI>
            <LI><B>Bluetooth GPS/ADS-B</B> - enables receiving GPS and/or ADS-B information from an
                external device over a Bluetooth connection.  There are two selections available so
                you can have two bluetooth devices (eg, one GPS and one ADS-B).
                <UL>
                    <LI>The very first time you are going to use a particular device with this
                        Android, you must pair it by going to the Android's settings page, then
                        find Bluetooth (possibly under Wireless & Networks).  You may then have to
                        click some button to get the new device to show up.  Then follow the prompts
                        to get it to pair up.  Once successfully paired, it does not need to be
                        paired up again.</LI>
                    <LI>Once the device is paired up, select it from the <TT>(select)</TT> box.  If
                        the device isn't listed there, try clicking the <TT>Refresh</TT> button at
                        the bottom of the selection box.</LI>
                    <LI>The <B>Secure</B> checkbox is provided for those devices that require a
                        secure connection.  If you aren't sure which you need, try one then the
                        other.</LI>
                    <LI>Once the device is selected and you have set the <TT>Secure</TT> checkbox
                        one way or the other, check the checkbox by the <TT>Bluetooth GPS/ADS-B</TT>
                        message and it should connect assuming it is in range and operating.</LI>
                    <LI>Bluetooth can be picky about connecting so you may have to restart the app
                        after a connection failure to get it to work.  To restart the app, click on
                        the Android's menu button then select <TT>Exit</TT> then re-open the app.
                        It may also help to turn the device you are trying to connect with off then
                        back on.</LI>
                    <LI>Once the device starts sending data to the app, the status message below
                        the <TT>Secure</TT> checkbox will start counting the number of bytes
                        received.</LI>
                </UL>
                <IMG SRC="sensors-blue-qtr.png">
            </LI>
            <LI><B>WiFi UDP GPS/ADS-B</B> - enables receiving GPS and/or ADS-B information from an
                external device over a WiFi UDP port.  More than one external device can send
                information to the app at a time using the same UDP port.  There are two selections
                available so you can have two different UDP ports if necessary.
                <UL>
                    <LI>Enter the port number your device will be sending on in the port box.  For
                        example, <A HREF="http://stratux.me/">Stratux</A> seems to like port
                        4000.</LI>
                    <LI>Check the checkbox next to the <TT>WiFi UDP GPS/ADS-B</TT> message and it
                        should start listening for inbound packets.</LI>
                    <LI>There is no connection as such as there is with Bluetooth or TCP, but the
                        status message below the port number box should start counting bytes as it
                        receives packets.</LI>
                </UL>
                <IMG SRC="sensors-udp-qtr.png">
            </LI>
            <LI><B>WiFi TCP GPS/ADS-B</B> - enables receiving GPS and/or ADS-B information from an
                external device over a WiFi TCP connection.  More than one external device can send
                information to the app at a time using the same TCP port.  There are two selections
                available so you can have two different TCP ports if necessary.
                <UL>
                    <LI>Enter the port number your device will be sending on in the port box.</LI>
                    <LI>Check the checkbox next to the <TT>WiFi TCP GPS/ADS-B</TT> message and it
                        should start listening for inbound connections.</LI>
                    <LI>The status message box below the port number will indicate how many inbound
                        connections have been established, so you can see if your device has
                        connected or not.</LI>
                </UL>
            </LI>
        </UL>
        <P>NOTE:  You should only have just one source of GPS information enabled at a time so
            the app doesn't receive closely spaced (distance-wise and time-wise) readings.</P>
        <P>The Bluetooth and WiFi types accept dump1090, dump978, GDL-90 and NMEA packets in any mix.</P>
        <UL>
            <LI><B>dump1090</B> is a program available on the Internet that decodes ADS-B packets
                received from an SDR (software defined radio).  The author has successfully used it
                with a Linux-based Raspberry PI.  The computer
                (Raspberry PI) runs the <TT>dump1090</TT> program
                then pipes the data to an Android WiFi TCP port using <TT>nc</TT> (netcat) or
                similar program.  It can either literally use WiFi or can use <TT>adb forward</TT>
                to send the data over a USB cable between the laptop and the Android device as the
                WiFi may be unreliable.
            <LI><B>dump978</B> is a program available on the Internet that decodes ADS-B packets
                received from an SDR (software defined radio).  The author has successfully used it
                with a Windows-based laptop and with a Linux-based Raspberry PI.  The computer
                (laptop or Raspberry PI) runs the <TT>rtl_sdr</TT> and <TT>dump978</TT> programs
                then pipes the data to an Android WiFi TCP port using <TT>nc</TT> (netcat) or
                similar program.  It can either literally use WiFi or can use <TT>adb forward</TT>
                to send the data over a USB cable between the laptop and the Android device as the
                WiFi may be unreliable.  WairToNow currently processes basic, long and uplink
                message types.
            <LI><B>GDL-90</B> is a protocol used by ADS-B equipment to send ADS-B information to
                display devices.  WairToNow currently processes basic, heartbeat, long, ownship,
                ownship/geoalt, traffic, and uplink messages.
            <LI><B>NMEA</B> is a protocol used by GPS equipment to send GPS position information to
                display devices.  WairToNow currently processes GGA, GSV, RMC, RTM and VTG messages.
