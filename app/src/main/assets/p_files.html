        <P>A simple file browser showing the data files.</P>
        <P><B>&lt;dir&gt;</B> - indicates a directory (folder) that you
            can navigate into.  Otherwise the size of the file in bytes
            is displayed.</P>
        <P>Some files can be opened and viewed, such as text and image
            files.  The text files can be edited with a simple built
            in editor and saved.  Use with caution, as saving corrupt
            data can cause the app to crash.</P>
        <P>You can also delete files if desired.</P>
        <P>After making changes, use <B>Menu</B> then <B>Exit</B>, to
            be sure the changes are used by the app.  Otherwise, the
            app may still use in-memory copies of data from the files.</P>
        <P>These directories are excluded from standard Android app backup
            as they can be re-downloaded from the WairToNow server or
            automatically re-generated:</P>
