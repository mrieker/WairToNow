        <H2>Route Page</H2>
        <P>This page has a form suitable for copying an IFR
            clearance and stepping through the route.  It can
            also be used on VFR flights for sequencing through
            a route.</P>
        <P><B>NOTE:</B>  You most likely will not be able to enter the
            clearance as fast as a controller will read it to
            you, so you will have to write it down first.  But
            this page will validate the route for you and sequence
            through the waypoints.</P>
        The form:
        <UL>
            <LI><B>destination</B> - enter the final point of the
                flight, either a user waypoint or the FAA or ICAO
                ident of an airport.
            <LI><B>route</B> - enter waypoints for the route,
                separated by spaces, case insensitive:
                <UL>
                    <LI>navaids and fixes
                    <LI>airways
                    <LI>user-defined waypoints
                    <LI><TT>@PP</TT> - <I>present position</I>
                        as seen by GPS.  Valid only at
                        beginning of route.
                    <LI><TT>@<I>aptid</I></TT> - airport, either faaid
                        or icaoid
                    <LI><TT>#<I>anything</I></TT> - ignored.  Useful for
                        things like <TT>#AF</TT>, <TT>#D</TT>, <TT>#J</TT>,
                        <TT>#RV</TT> for <I>as filed</I>, <I>direct</I>,
                        <I>join</I>, <I>radar vectors</I>, etc.
                        Note that for <TT>#AF</TT>,
                        you must enter the waypoints for the
                        rest of the route after the <TT>#AF</TT> if
                        you want the app to sequence through the
                        rest of the route.
                    <LI>Example:  <TT>@pp #bvy8 bosox v1 #j v146 alb</TT>
                </UL>
                The route must not start on an airway.  Use <TT>@PP</TT> at the
                beginning if you want it to start at your present position near an airway.
            <LI><B>altitude</B> - record altitude assignments here
            <LI><B>frequency</B> - record frequency assignments here
            <LI><B>transponder</B> - record transponder assignment here
            <LI><B>notes</B> - record anything else you want here
        </UL>
        <P>Only <B>destination</B> and <B>route</B> are checked
            for validity.  You may enter anything or nothing in
            the other fields as you like.</P>
        The buttons:
        <UL>
            <LI><B>validate</B> - checks entries in the
                <B>destination</B> and <B>route</B> boxes and
                computes the total distance
            <LI><B>track</B> - turns sequencing on/off.  When on,
                displays heading and distance to next waypoint
                on route and heading/distance between the
                remaining waypoints, as well as total remaining
                distance and time.  The destination on the
                chart page will be changed to successive waypoints
                as the flight progresses.  If grayed out, click the
                <B>validate</B> button.
                <P>Note:  The track button is disabled when
                    <A HREF="p_options.html">Option</A> <B>Type B</B>
                    is checked so as to, in the words of
                    <A HREF="http://www.faa.gov/documentlibrary/media/advisory_circular/ac_120-76c.pdf">
                        AC 120-76C
                    </A>, block the GPS from providing
                    false or misleading information.</P>
            <LI><B>save</B> - saves form values to flash file
            <LI><B>load</B> - loads form values from flash file
                <UL>
                    <LI>short clicking the name loads the file
                    <LI>long clicking opens a delete/rename menu
                </UL>
            <LI><B>clear</B> - clears all the form fields
        </UL>
        <P>NOTE:  It is recommended to save your entry so you
            won't lose it in case the app gets restarted.  You
            can use a simple name like <TT>x</TT> if you like.</P>
