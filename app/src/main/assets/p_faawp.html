        <H2>FAAWP1 and FAAWP2 Pages</H2>
        <P>These pages are used to view information related to FAA-defined waypoints.
            They consist of airports, fixes, localizers and navaids.  Each page is
            independent (like NAV1/NAV2 radios) and can be used to select different
            waypoints.  The history list is common to both however, so FAAWP2 can be used
            to select something that was in FAAWP1 a while ago and vice versa.</P>
        <P>NOTE:  If you click the FAAWP1 or FAAWP2 button and see a diagram or plate (secondary
            page), click the same button again to get back to the waypoint selection page (primary
            page).</P>
