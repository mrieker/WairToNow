        <H2>FAAWP1 and FAAWP2 pages</H2>
        <P>These pages are used to view information related to FAA-defined waypoints.
            They consist of airports, fixes, localizers and navaids.  Each page is
            independent (like NAV1/NAV2 radios) and can be used to select different
            waypoints.  The history list is common to both however, so FAAWP2 can be used
            to select something that was in FAAWP1 a while ago and vice versa.</P>

                            click the <B>Find</B> button.  You may also enter search terms such as
                            a city name.  Entering multiple words requires that the waypoint
                            description contains all the words given in the search box.
                        <LI>You may also click one of the history buttons listed below the text box
                            to get a recent waypoint.  Long-click the button to delete it from the list.
                        <LI>The <B>GoTo</B> button will set the waypoint as the current destination
                            and a line will be drawn from the airplane to the destination location
