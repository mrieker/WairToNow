        <H2>WairToNow, version <SCRIPT LANGUAGE=JAVASCRIPT>document.write (hvjso.getVersionName ())</SCRIPT></H2>
        <H3>... an aviation oriented map program from <A HREF="http://www.outerworldapps.com">Outer World Apps</A>.</H3>

        <P>The menu buttons at the bottom select the basic screen:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI><B><A HREF="p_chart.html">Chart</A></B> - main moving-map display using the selected chart as background
            <LI><B><A HREF="p_faawp.html">FAAWP1</A></B> - search for FAA-defined waypoint and display information about it
            <LI><B><A HREF="p_faawp.html">FAAWP2</A></B> - same as FAAWP1
            <LI><B><A HREF="p_userwp.html">UserWP</A></B> - search for user-defined waypoint

        </UL>

        <H3>Downloading charts</H3>
        <P>You must download data before using the app.  Download by clicking
            <B><A HREF="p_maint.html">Maint</A></B> button.</P>
        <P>NOTE:  If you download plates, it will give you the airport diagrams, SIDs STARs, IAPs, etc.
            It will also give you a runway diagram that is synthesized by WairToNow as many airports do
            not have an official FAA airport diagram.  These are constructed from the FAA data that has
            the lat/lon of <I>most</I> but not necessarily <I>all</I> runways for an airport.  Some
            airports don't have any runway lat/lon information provided at all, so you may not see some
            or any runways for a given airport.</P>
        <P>That being said, WairToNow will use OpenStreetMap tiles as a background for the diagram which
            most times has runway and taxiway outlines which are generally useful.  When you download
            the plates, WairToNow will start downloading the tiles for the corresponding runway
            backgrounds in a background thread.  The app will still function while this downloading is
            happening.</P>
        <UL>
            <LI>You must download the waypoints from the <B><A HREF="p_maint.html#misc">Misc</A></B>
                button.  This waypoint data includes airports, fixes, localizers, navaids and runways
                for the entire country.
            <LI>Everything else is optional, select what you want.  Avoid over-selecting as the download
                times can be significant.
            <LI>NOTE:  There is no selection for the Street maps, they are downloaded as needed, which
                requires an Internet connection at the time of use.  You can preload areas of interest
                by previewing the area where you have an internet connection, and WairToNow will save
                the tiles, so in that case an Internet connection would not be needed to view those same
                areas again.  Be sure to use a wide range of zoom when previewing so it will load all the
                tiles for the different zoom levels.
