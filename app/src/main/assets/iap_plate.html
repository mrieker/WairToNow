        <H2>Instrument Approach Procedure Plates</H2>

        <P>The plates are the images as provided by the FAA.  Be sure to
            validate that the ones you will be using are current and correct
            before using them in flight.

        <P><FONT COLOR=RED>Always be skeptical regarding any information provided
            by WairToNow.  Accept it only if and when it is confirmed by your
            aircraft's approved navigation systems and as provided by the FAA on
            the plate itself.  If there is <B>any uncertainty</B> in flight using
            these plates, <B><I>immediately execute your missed approach
            instructions!</I></B></FONT></P>

        <H3>Timer</H3>
        <P>In the upper-right corner is a yellow triangle button.  Clicking
            on it will start a count-up timer that can be of use during a
            non-precision approach.  To reset the time to 0:00, click the
            numbers and it will collapse back to the triangle button, then
            click the button again to start the counter back up.</P>

        <H3>DME</H3>
        <P>The button in the lower-left corner can be used to obtain DME and radial
            information.  Needless to say, the DME and radial information is calculated
            by using the latest GPS position and the lat/lon of the waypoint
            from the database.  If there is elevation information available
            for the waypoint (such as with a VOR or localizer), the slant range
            distance will be shown, otherwise it is a simple over-the-ground
            distance.  Slant-range distances will be shown in <I>italics</I>,
            and over-the-ground distances will be shown normally.</P>
        <P>Clicking the button will bring up a dialog box that you can type a
            waypoint name in.  It will accept airport ICAO ids (eg, <TT>KBOS</TT>),
            navaid ids (eg, <TT>BOS</TT>), and localizers beginning with 
            <TT>I</TT>, (eg, <TT>IBOS</TT> or <TT>I-BOS</TT>), five-letter fix ids
            (eg, <TT>BOSOX</TT>), and runway thresholds given by <TT>RW<I>number</I></TT>
            (eg, <TT>RW04R</TT>).  You can enter them in upper or lower case, it doesn't
            matter.</P>
        <P>There are also 3 checkboxes provided for each waypoint selected:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI><B>D</B> - display distance information, always in nautical miles
            <LI><B>T</B> - display time-to-waypoint information, in minutes:seconds
                            (negative means the waypoint is behind you)
            <LI><B>R</B> - display radial FROM information, always in magnetic degrees
                            (useful for validating cross-radials along the approach course)
        </UL>
        <P>If you do not check any boxes, <B>D</B> will be assumed.</P>
        <P>The text is formatted in the box to minimize screen area consumed.</P>
        <P>To remove the DME information display, click on the numbers and they
            will collapse back into the triangle button.  Click the triangle button
            to get the numbers back.</P>
        <P>To add additional waypoints or modify the list, long-click on the numbers
            or the triangle button.  You may select as many waypoints as you like,
            provided there is sufficient area on the screen to display them.</P>

        <H3>CIFP</H3>
        <P>The yellow button in the lower right corner displays FAA-provided Coded Instrument
            Flight Procedure information.  In a nutshell, it steps you through the approach.</P>
        <P>There are two ways to select the IAF for an approach.  One is using the buttons that
            appear near the IAF on the plate, giving a graphics-based selection.  The other is via
            a menu listing the IAFs in alphabetical order.  For a radar-vectored approach, select
            the <TT>(rv)</TT> entry from the button near the airport or from the menu.</P>
        <P>The yellow button behaves differently depending on what is happening:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI>Nothing showing:
                <UL>
                    <LI>short click: show IAF selection buttons</LI>
                    <LI>long click: show IAF selection menu</LI>
                </UL>
            </LI>
            <LI>Starting waypoint selection buttons showing:
                <UL>
                    <LI>short click: clear IAF selection buttons from screen</LI>
                    <LI>long click: show IAF selection menu instead of buttons</LI>
                </UL>
            </LI>
            <LI>CIFP route showing:
                <UL>
                    <LI>short click: hide/show text box describing step</LI>
                    <LI>long click: discontinue approach, clear route from screen</LI>
                </UL>
            </LI>
        </UL>
        <P>NOTE:  When an approach has closely spaced IAFs, the buttons may overlap.  Either
            spread them apart with your fingers before selecting or use the menu.</P>
        <P>Some plates have more than one approach depicted, such as <TT>ILS or LOC</TT>.  So you
            will have to select which approach you want as well as which IAF you want.  The buttons
            will show the <TT>ILS</TT> and <TT>LOC</TT> strings on each button, so click whichever
            one you want.  The menu will have separate <TT>ILS</TT> and <TT>LOC</TT> sections.</P>
        <P>When an IAF has been selected, a textual step-by-step description will be shown in
            the lower right corner of the screen.  Also, dots will be drawn on the plate image
            showing the corresponding route.  To collapse the text (but leave the dots intact), do
            a short click on the text box and it will shrink to a small triangle button.  A long
            click on either the triangle button or text box will clear both the text and the
            dots.</P>
        <P>The text and dot colors are as follows:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI>Magenta indicates the current leg</LI>
            <LI>Green indicates future normal legs</LI>
            <LI>Cyan indicates future missed-approach legs</LI>
        </UL>
        <P>When you initially select an approach, it will draw magenta dots from where you are
            currently positioned to the IAF that you selected from buttons or the menu.  <I>You do
            not have to fly all the way to that fix.</I>  Just intercept the next segment of the
            approach and when you get established on that segment, it will become current (magenta)
            and the old magenta dots and text will be removed.</P>
        <P>The CIFP text often gives altitudes for the legs.  <I>Especially in the case of
            descent</I>, verify the altitude given with that on the plate image itself before
            changing altitude.</P>
        <P>The altitude displayed in the text box for the runway waypoint (eg, <TT>RW16</TT>)
            <B>is not the DA, DH, MDA etc</B> so do not treat it as such!  It is the altitude that
            a normal descent glide path would bring you to over the numbers.  <I>You <B>must</B>
            use the DA, DH, MDA etc provided in the table on the plate image to determine the
            correct altitude.</I></P>
        <P>Hold and Procedure Turn dots will be depicted based on the aircraft's current ground
            speed as sensed by the GPS, and assuming one minute legs and standard rate turns.  Do
            not feel obligated to follow what is being depicted by the CIFP dots or text, always
            operate using best practices.</P>
        <P>The display will automatically sequence into the missed approach segment upon entering
            the first leg of the missed approach procedure (shown in cyan), which usually begins at
            the runway numbers waypoint (no matter what your altitude is).  If you have determined
            that a missed approach is appropriate prior to that point, you can climb straight ahead
            until you are approximately over the numbers and let WairToNow assist you, or execute
            the missed approach unassisted.</P>
        <P><FONT COLOR=RED>The information on the plate image itself as provided by the FAA takes
            precedence over the CIFP information.  <I>If there is any discrepancy or confusion,
            discontinue use of the CIFP information!</I>  A long click on the yellow button or
            the textual display will remove the dots and text from the display.</FONT></P>
        <P><IMG WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=640 SRC="cifp-sample-400.png"></P>
        <H3>Georeferencing</H3>
        <P>The FAA is providing georeference information for some approach procedures.
            WairToNow will attempt to use this information where available.  It will be
            indicated by the absence of an editing triangle at the top of the page, and
            the airport runways will be overdrawn with magenta lines.  If the magenta
            lines are in the correct position, ie, they overlay the black FAA-drawn
            runway lines, the georeference information is most likely valid.  Note that
            all runways may not be lined over, but some are.  The important thing is that
            for those that are lined over, the lines are in the correct position.  The
            positions do not have to be exact but should be very close.
            <BR><IMG WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=128 SRC="iap_rwy_verify_example.png"></P>
        <P>WairToNow also provides a database of machine-detected reference points
            for most approach procedures that do not have FAA-provided georefence
            information.  They are indicated by blue dots on the plate at the
            machine-detected waypoints. It is recommended to verify these points before
            using the plate as follows:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI>Click the triangle button at the top center of the plate.
                You should see blue boxes appear around the reference points with
                the names of the fixes below the boxes in blue.
            <LI>Verify that the name below each of the boxes in blue <I>matches
                the name of the fix as printed on the plate by the FAA</I>.
                <BR><IMG WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=128 SRC="iap_waypt_verify.png">
            <LI>Verify that the black FAA-drawn runway lines are overdrawn by
                magenta WairToNow-drawn runway lines.  You may need to zoom in
                on the airport area quite a bit to see them.  The lines do not
                need to exactly match position but should be close.  Also, sometimes
                a runway line or two will be missing one way or the other which
                doesn't matter.  It is the position that is important.
                <BR><IMG WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=128 SRC="iap_rwy_verify_example.png">
            <LI>Click the triangle button again and the boxes will go away.
        </UL>
        <P>If these points are missing or incorrectly named or otherwise inadequate,
            you may manually enter reference points and they will override the
            provided points. The procedure is:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI>Click the triangle button at the top center of the plate.
                It should open a row of buttons and a text box, along with
                some crosshairs.  Any reference points currently defined
                for the plate should have a box drawn around them with the
                waypoint name shown below the box.
            <LI>Position the crosshairs over a fix you wish to add to the
                ones used.  You may want to zoom in quite a bit to get good
                positioning.  Then type the name of the fix in the text box
                and click the <B>Save</B> button.  If the fix name is valid,
                a dot will be placed at the crosshair position along with a
                box and the fix name.
            <LI>To delete a reference point, including a machine-detected
                one, type the fix name in the box and click the <B>Delete</B>
                button.
        </UL>
        <P>The dot/box color has these meanings:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI><FONT COLOR=BLUE>Blue</FONT> - machine generated point being used for georeferencing
            <LI><FONT COLOR=CYAN>Cyan</FONT> - machine generated point not being used for georeferencing
            <LI><FONT COLOR=RED>Red</FONT> - manually entered point giving poor geometry
            <LI><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>Yellow</FONT> - manually entered point not being used for georeferencing
            <LI><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Green</FONT> - manually entered point being used for georeferencing
        </UL>
        <P>Two reference points are required for georeferencing to work.  WairToNow will
            pick two out of those it has that give the best geometry.</P>
        <P><FONT COLOR=RED>Be aware that even though there is nothing on a plate
            indicating that a fix as drawn by the FAA is not drawn to scale,
            <I>sometimes they are not</I>.  So you may need to try several points
            before getting everything, including the runways, to line up.</FONT></P>
