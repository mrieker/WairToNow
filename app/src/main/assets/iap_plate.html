        <P><FONT COLOR=RED>Always be skeptical regarding any information provided
            by WairToNow.  Accept it only if and when it is confirmed by your
            aircraft's approved navigation systems and as provided by the FAA on
            the plate itself.  If there is <B>any uncertainty</B> in flight using
            these plates, <B><I>immediately execute your missed approach
            instructions!</I></B></FONT></P>

        <A NAME="timer"></A><H3>Timer</H3>
        <P>In the upper-right corner is a yellow triangle button.  Clicking
            on it will start a count-up timer that can be of use during a
            non-precision approach.  To reset the time to 0:00, click the
            numbers and it will collapse back to the triangle button, then
            click the button again to start the counter back up.</P>

        <A NAME="dme"></A><H3>DME</H3>
        <P>The button in the lower-left corner can be used to obtain DME and radial
            information.  Needless to say, the DME and radial information is calculated
            by using the latest GPS position and the lat/lon of the waypoint
            from the database.  If there is elevation information available
            for the waypoint (such as with a VOR or localizer), the slant range
            distance will be shown, otherwise it is a simple over-the-ground
            distance.  Slant-range distances will be shown in <I>italics</I>,
            and over-the-ground distances will be shown normally.</P>
        <P>Clicking the button will bring up a dialog box that you can type a
            waypoint name in.  It will accept airport ICAO ids (eg, <TT>KBOS</TT>),
            navaid ids (eg, <TT>BOS</TT>), and localizers beginning with 
            <TT>I</TT>, (eg, <TT>IBOS</TT> or <TT>I-BOS</TT>), five-letter fix ids
            (eg, <TT>BOSOX</TT>), and runway thresholds given by <TT>RW<I>number</I></TT>
            (eg, <TT>RW04R</TT>).  You can enter them in upper or lower case, it doesn't
            matter.</P>
        <P>There are also 3 checkboxes provided for each waypoint selected:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI><B>D</B> - display distance information, always in nautical miles
                <UL>
                    <LI><I>italics</I> represents slant-range distance where the waypoint
                        elevation is available
                    <LI>otherwise over-the-ground distance is
                        displayed using normal text
                </UL>
            <LI><B>T</B> - display time-to-waypoint information, in minutes:seconds
                at the present closing rate (negative means the waypoint is behind you)
            <LI><B>R</B> - display radial FROM information, always in magnetic degrees
                (useful for validating cross-radials along the approach course)
                <UL>
                    <LI><I>italics</I> represents VOR radial as a real VOR receiver would display
                    <LI>otherwise it is the bearing from the waypoint (as would be
                        indicated by a compass in the aircraft) in normal text
                </UL>
        </UL>
        <P>If you do not check any boxes, <B>D</B> will be assumed.</P>
        <P>The text is formatted in the box to minimize screen area consumed.</P>
        <P>To remove the DME information display, click on the numbers and they
            will collapse back into the triangle button.  Click the triangle button
            to get the numbers back.</P>
        <P>To add additional waypoints or modify the list, long-click on the numbers
            or the triangle button.  You may select as many waypoints as you like,
            provided there is sufficient area on the screen to display them.</P>

        <A NAME="cifp"></A><H3>CIFP</H3>
        <P>The yellow button in the lower right corner displays FAA-provided Coded Instrument
            Flight Procedure information.  In a nutshell, it steps you through the approach.</P>
        <P>There are two ways to select the IAF for an approach.  One is using the buttons that
            appear near the IAF on the plate, giving a graphics-based selection.  The other is via
            a menu listing the IAFs in alphabetical order.  For a radar-vectored approach, select
            the <TT>(rv)</TT> entry from the button near the airport or from the menu.</P>
        <P>In addition to the IAFs, some or all of the intermediate fixes (IFs) are selectable with
            the button near their name or from the menu.  This feature is useful when a radar
            controller clears you direct to an IF.  The IF names are shown in lower case whereas the
            IAF names are shown in upper case.</P>
        <P>The yellow button behaves differently depending on what is happening:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI>Nothing showing:
                <UL>
                    <LI>short click: show IAF selection buttons</LI>
                    <LI>long click: show IAF selection menu</LI>
                </UL>
            </LI>
            <LI>Starting waypoint selection buttons showing:
                <UL>
                    <LI>short click: clear IAF selection buttons from screen</LI>
                    <LI>long click: show IAF selection menu instead of buttons</LI>
                </UL>
            </LI>
            <LI>CIFP route showing:
                <UL>
                    <LI>short click: hide/show text box describing step</LI>
                    <LI>long click: discontinue approach, clear route from screen</LI>
                </UL>
            </LI>
        </UL>
        <P>NOTE:  When an approach has closely spaced IAFs, the buttons may overlap.  Either
            spread them apart with your fingers before selecting or use the menu.</P>
        <P>Some plates have more than one approach depicted, such as <TT>ILS or LOC</TT>.  So you
            will have to select which approach you want as well as which IAF you want.  The buttons
            will show the <TT>ILS</TT> and <TT>LOC</TT> strings on each button, so click whichever
            one you want.  The menu will have separate <TT>ILS</TT> and <TT>LOC</TT> sections.</P>
        <P>When an IAF has been selected, a textual step-by-step description will be shown in
            the lower right corner of the screen.  Also, dots will be drawn on the plate image
            showing the corresponding route.  To collapse the text (but leave the dots intact), do
            a short click on the text box and it will shrink to a small triangle button.  A long
            click on either the triangle button or text box will prompt you for one of these
            actions:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI><B>DISCONTINUE</B> - clears the dots and text from the plate</LI>
            <LI><B>RESTART</B> - starts the sequencing from the beginning of the selected segment</LI>
            <LI><B>KEEP IT</B> - keeps everything as it is, no changes</LI>
        </UL>
        <P>The text and dot colors are as follows:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI>Magenta indicates the current leg</LI>
            <LI>Green indicates future normal legs</LI>
            <LI>Cyan indicates future missed-approach legs</LI>
        </UL>
        <P>When you initially select an approach, it will draw magenta dots from where you are
            currently positioned to the IAF that you selected from buttons or the menu.  <I>You do
            not have to fly all the way to that fix.</I>  Just intercept the next segment of the
            approach and when you get established on that segment, it will become current (magenta)
            and the old magenta dots and text will be removed.</P>
        <P>For the radar vector transition (rv), the initial dotted line will track the aircraft
            heading, showing the pilot where the current radar vector will intercept the final
            approach course.  If the aircraft is headed away from the final approach course,
            no line will be shown.</P>
        <P>The CIFP text often gives altitudes for the legs.  <I>Especially in the case of
            descent</I>, verify the altitude given with that on the plate image itself (in black)
            before changing altitude.</P>
        <P><FONT COLOR=RED>The altitude displayed in the text box for the runway waypoint (eg, <TT>RW16</TT>)
            <B>is not the DA, DH, MDA etc</B> so do not treat it as such!  It is the altitude that
            a normal descent glide path would bring you to over the numbers.  <I>You <B>must</B>
            use the DA, DH, MDA etc provided in the table on the plate image to determine the
            correct altitude.</I></FONT></P>
        <P>Hold and Procedure Turn dots will be depicted based on the aircraft's current ground
            speed as sensed by the GPS, and assuming one minute legs and standard rate turns.  Do
            not feel obligated to follow what is being depicted by the CIFP dots or text, always
            operate using best practices.</P>
        <P>The display will automatically sequence into the missed approach segment upon entering
            the first leg of the missed approach procedure (shown in cyan), which usually begins at
            the runway numbers waypoint (no matter what your altitude is).  If you have determined
            that a missed approach is appropriate prior to that point, you can climb straight ahead
            until you are approximately over the numbers and let WairToNow assist you, or execute
            the missed approach unassisted.</P>
        <P><FONT COLOR=RED>The information on the plate image itself as provided by the FAA takes
            precedence over the CIFP information.  <I>If there is any discrepancy or confusion,
            discontinue use of the CIFP information!</I>  A long click on the yellow button or
            the textual display will remove the dots and text from the display.</FONT></P>
        <P><IMG WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=640 SRC="cifp-sample-400.png"></P>

        <A NAME="georefing"></A><H3>Georeferencing</H3>
        <P><IMG WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=128 SRC="iap_rwy_verify_example.png" ALIGN=LEFT>
            The FAA is providing georeference information for most approach procedures.
            WairToNow will attempt to use this information where available to do things like
            identify the aircraft's current position on the plate.  The presence of the georeference
            information will be indicated by the airport runways being overdrawn with magenta
            lines for the first ten seconds of display.  If the magenta
            lines are in the correct position, ie, they overlay the black FAA-drawn
            runway lines, the georeference information is most likely valid.  Note that
            all runways may not be lined over, but some are.  The important thing is that
            for those that are lined over, the lines are in the correct position.  The
            positions do not have to be exact but should be very close.</P>
        <P>Note that not everything on the plate is drawn to scale.  Many navaids and intersections
            used for the approach would be off the plate if drawn to scale.  Such a condition is
            <I>usually</I> indicated on the plate but sometimes is not.  <I>ALWAYS use your
            aircraft's approved navigation systems to verify your position!</I></P>

        <A NAME="circling"></A><H3>Circling</H3>
        <P><IMG WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=160 SRC="circle_A.png" ALIGN=LEFT>
            The plates have a shaded area surrounding the airport indicating the
            circling approach protected area.  The size shown is based on the circling
            category selected on the <A HREF="p_options.html">Options</A> page.  Again,
            <I>be skeptical</I> of the area indicated and accept it only after you have
            verified it, ie, it looks of reasonable shape and radius compared to runway
            length.</P>
        <P>For newer plates with a <IMG SRC="circletag.png"> tag next to the word <TT>CIRCLING</TT>
            in the table indicating circling MDA, the circling radius (in nm) from runway endpoints
            based on altitude (in ft) and speed category can be found in this table:</P>

        <P>WairToNow provides synthetic ILS/DME approach plates for practicing ILS approaches where
