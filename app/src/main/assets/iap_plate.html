        <H2>Instrument Approach Procedure Plates</H2>

        <P>The plates are the images as provided by the FAA.  Be sure to
            validate that the ones you will be using are current and correct
            before using them in flight.

        <P><FONT COLOR=RED>Always be skeptical regarding any information provided
            by WairToNow.  Accept it only if and when it is confirmed by your
            aircraft's approved navigation systems and as provided by the FAA on
            the plate itself.  If there is <B>any uncertainty</B> in flight using
            these plates, <B><I>immediately execute your missed approach
            instructions!</I></B></FONT></P>

        <H3>Timer</H3>
        <P>In the upper-right corner is a yellow triangle button.  Clicking
            on it will start a count-up timer that can be of use during a
            non-precision approach.  To reset the time to 0:00, click the
            numbers and it will collapse back to the triangle button, then
            click the button again to start the counter back up.</P>

        <H3>DME</H3>
        <P>The button in the lower-left corner can be used to obtain DME
            information.  Needless to say, the DME information is calculated
            by using the latest GPS position and the lat/lon of the waypoint
            from the database.  If there is elevation information available
            for the waypoint (such as with a VOR or localizer), the slant range
            distance will be shown, otherwise it is a simple over-the-ground
            distance.  Slant-range distances will be shown in <I>italics</I>,
            and over-the-ground distances will be shown normally.</P>
        <P>Clicking the button will bring up a dialog box that you can type a
            waypoint name in.  It will accept airport ICAO ids (eg, <TT>KBOS</TT>),
            navaid ids (eg, <TT>BOS</TT>), and localizers beginning with 
            <TT>I</TT>, (eg, <TT>IBOS</TT> or <TT>I-BOS</TT>), five-letter fix ids,
            and runway thresholds given by <TT>RW<I>number</I></TT> (eg,
            <TT>RW04R</TT>).  You can enter them in upper or lower case, it doesn't
            matter.</P>
        <P>There are also 3 checkboxes provided:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI><B>D</B> - display distance information, always in nautical miles
            <LI><B>T</B> - display time-to-waypoint information, in minutes:seconds
                            (negative means the waypoint is behind you)
            <LI><B>R</B> - display radial FROM information, always in magnetic degrees
                            (useful for validating cross-radials along the approach course)
        </UL>
        <P>If you do not check any boxes, <B>D</B> will be assumed.</P>
        <P>The text is formatted in the box to minimize screen area consumed.</P>
        <P>To remove the DME information display, click on the numbers and they
            will collapse back into the triangle button.  Click the triangle button
            to get the numbers back.</P>
        <P>To add additional waypoints or modify the list, long-click on the numbers
            or the triangle button.  You may select as many waypoints as you like,
            provided there is sufficient area on the screen to display them.</P>

        <H3>Georeferencing</H3>
        <P>WairToNow provides a database of machine-detected reference points for
            most approach procedures.  They are indicated by blue dots on the plate.
            It is recommended to verify these points before using the plate:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI>Click the triangle button at the top center of the plate.
                You should see blue boxes appear around the reference points with
                the names of the fixes below the boxes in blue.
            <LI>Verify that the name below each of the boxes in blue <I>matches
                the name of the fix as printed on the plate by the FAA</I>.
                <BR><IMG WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=128 SRC="iap_waypt_verify.png">
            <LI>Verify that the black FAA-drawn runway lines are overdrawn by
                magenta WairToNow-drawn runway lines.  You may need to zoom in
                on the airport area quite a bit to see them.  The lines do not
                need to exactly match position but should be close.  Also, sometimes
                a runway line or two will be missing one way or the other which
                doesn't matter.  It is the position that is important.
                <BR><IMG WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=128 SRC="iap_rwy_verify_example.png">
            <LI>Click the triangle button again and the boxes will go away.
        </UL>
        <P>If these points are missing or incorrectly named or otherwise inadequate,
            you may manually enter reference points and they will override the
            provided points. The procedure is:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI>Click the triangle button at the top center of the plate.
                It should open a row of buttons and a text box, along with
                some crosshairs.  Any reference points currently defined
                for the plate should have a box drawn around them with the
                waypoint name shown below the box.
            <LI>Position the crosshairs over a fix you wish to add to the
                ones used.  You may want to zoom in quite a bit to get good
                positioning.  Then type the name of the fix in the text box
                and click the <B>Save</B> button.  If the fix name is valid,
                a dot will be placed at the crosshair position along with a
                box and the fix name.
            <LI>To delete a reference point, including a machine-detected
                one, type the fix name in the box and click the <B>Delete</B>
                button.
        </UL>
        <P>The dot/box color has these meanings:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI><FONT COLOR=BLUE>Blue</FONT> - machine generated point being used for georeferencing
            <LI><FONT COLOR=CYAN>Cyan</FONT> - machine generated point not being used for georeferencing
            <LI><FONT COLOR=RED>Red</FONT> - manually entered point giving poor geometry
            <LI><FONT COLOR=YELLOW>Yellow</FONT> - manually entered point not being used for georeferencing
            <LI><FONT COLOR=GREEN>Green</FONT> - manually entered point being used for georeferencing
        </UL>
        <P>Two reference points are required for georeferencing to work.  WairToNow will
            pick two out of those it has that give the best geometry.</P>
        <P><FONT COLOR=RED>Be aware that even though there is nothing on a plate
            indicating that a fix as drawn by the FAA is not drawn to scale,
            <I>sometimes they are not</I>.  So you may need to try several points
            before getting everything, including the runways, to line up.</FONT></P>
