        <H3> European Plate Georeferencing </H3>
        <P>Some of the plates have georeference information provided by the server.  Plates that
            do not have server georeferencing can be manually georeferenced.  You can download
            manual georeferences contributed by other users and you may contribute georeference
            information that you create.</P>
        <H3> Plate Georeference Status </H3>
        <UL>
            <LI><A HREF="eurogeoref_self.html">manually georeferenced plates saved locally</A></LI>
            <LI><A HREF="eurogeoref_cont.html">manually georeferenced plates contributed</A></LI>

        <P>There are two types of manual georeferencing:</P>
        <UL>
            <LI><B>Four Point:</B> This method can be used when the lat/lon lines on the plate to
                be georeferenced are vertical and horizontal, ie, no noticeable rotation or pinching
                is present.  Two of the points must define latitudes and the other two must define
                longitudes.
                <UL>
                    <LI>Place the two latitude points anywhere with the greatest separation of
                        latitude values.  Likewise with longitude points.</LI>
                </UL>
            <LI><B>Eight Point:</B> This method must be used when the <B>Four Point</B> method can
                not, ie, there is some rotation and/or pinching.  Four of the points must define
                latitudes and the other four must define longitudes.
                <UL>
                    <LI>Place two points close to each of the four edges of the plate.  The points
                        along any one edge should be separated as much as possible.

        <H3> Entering a Point </H3>
        <OL>
            <LI>Open the georeference editing buttons by clicking the triangle button
                <IMG SRC="eurogeoref-openbutton.png"> near the bottom of the screen.
                A red triangle indicates that some more points are needed for georef
                to be valid.  Green means there are enough points to georef the plate.
                Gray means there is server-provided georeferencing for the plate, but
                you can override it by entering manual georefencing information.</LI>
            <LI>Click the arrow buttons to move the
                magenta cursor lines to the georeference point to be entered.
                Long hold press for large jumps; quick taps for small steps.<BR>
                <IMG SRC="eurogeoref-cursorbuttons.png" WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=193></LI>
            <LI>Use the <B>deg</B> <B>min</B> <B>sec</B> buttons to enter either a latitude or
                longitude for the given point.  Use <B>FreeForm</B> to enter minute or second
                values with the keyboard.</LI>
            <LI>Click <B>SAVE</B> to write the point to flash storage.  A triangle will be placed
                at the saved point with the saved numeric value.  If no triangle appears, make sure
                that degrees, minutes and seconds have been entered.</LI>
            <LI>Repeat until all 4 or 8 points have been entered.  The triangles will turn green
                when a valid mapping has been entered.  You may get 4 green on the way to entering
                8 points, but the mapping with the 4 is probably not correct and you should proceed
                to enter a total of 8.
        </OL>
        <H3> Deleting a Point </H3>
        <OL>
            <LI>Use arrow buttons to move cursor somewhere on the triangle of the point to be
                deleted.  The triangle should turn yellow.</LI>
            <LI>Click the <B>DELETE</B> button.</LI>
        </OL>
        <H3> Contributing a Georeference </H3>
        <P>Once you have completed a georeference and it shows the markers in green, you can
            contribute the mapping for others to use by clicking the <B>CONTRIB</B> button.
            Internet connectivity is required for this to work.  If you do not have connectivity
            at the moment, you can contribute it later.</P>
        <H3> 4 Point Example </H3>
        <P>This example only needs 4 points because the latitude and longitude lines are horizontal
            and vertical within a couple pixels.  It's easy to tell that they are vertical and
            horizontal by placing the magenta cursor lines over the latitude and longitude lines.</P>
        <P>There are 2 latitude markers along the left edge and 2 longitude markers along the
            bottom edge.</P>

        <H3> 8 Point Example </H3>
        <P>This example requires 8 points because the latitude and longitude lines are not horizontal
            and vertical.  There are 2 markers along each of the 4 edges.  If only 4 points were given,
            the aircraft placement wouldn't be correct when a distance away from the 4 given points.</P>

        <H3> 4 Point Aerodrome Example </H3>
        <P>This example of using 4 points uses 4 runway ends to give a good spread of latitude and
            longitude inputs.  The east/west runway gives a good spread of longitude, and the
            north/south runway gives a good spread of latitude.</P>
        <P>It is valid to use 4 points because the diagram is oriented East up, so the lines of
            latitude and longitude are vertical and horizontal.  If the diagram were slightly
            rotated, eg, 100&#176; up, 8 points would be needed.</P>
