                <B>NOTE:</B>  If only a selection for <B>Street</B> appears, it is usually because
                the device has not received a GPS position report, the GPS position is not in an
                area covered by the app, or that the database has not been
                <A HREF="p_maint.html">downloaded</A>.
            <LI>Upper left corner cloud shows the latest position received by the GPS.
                The cloud will shrink to a red triangle button when clicked and can be
                restored by clicking the red triangle.
                The latest GPS position is indicated by the red airplane icon
                on the map, provided the display contains the lat/lon of the latest GPS
                position.
            <LI>Lower left corner cloud shows the lat/lon position of the center of the
                display, zoom factor and map rotation (see below).  There will also be a
                blue cross in the center if the airplane is not centered in the display.
                The cloud and line will shrink to a blue triangle button when clicked and
                can be restored by clicking the blue triangle.
            <LI>If a course is selected (via <A HREF="p_faawp.html">FAAWP1/2</A>,
                <A HREF="p_userwp.html">UserWP</A> GoTo buttons), the course information
                will be shown in the upper right corner cloud in green along with a green course
                line.  The cloud and line may be hidden by clicking on the cloud, shrinking it to
                a green triangle, and can be restored by clicking the green triangle.  The course
                can be cleared by long-clicking on the cloud or green triangle button.
            <LI>Select a different chart by either clicking the <B>Chart</B> button in
                the menu bar at the bottom of the screen or by clicking the black triangle
                or <B>select chart</B> cloud in the lower right corner of the map.
        </UL>
        <P><B>NOTE:</B>  If you manually pan the display, the chart will fix in place and
            will not track movement of the airplane.  The airplane will move but the chart
            will not.  To re-engage tracking, click the Android menu button then
            click <B>Re-center</B>.  The chart will move to maintain the airplane in the
            center of the display, the blue cross will be taken away and the information
            in the lower left corner cloud will be reduced to a minimum.</P>
        <P>The details of what appears in the lower left corner cloud may vary based
            on the current situation.  At most, lines such as these will appear:</P>
