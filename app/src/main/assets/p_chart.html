            <LI>Upper left corner cloud shows the latest information received by the GPS,
                including time, altitude, heading and speed.  The cloud will shrink to a red
                triangle button when clicked and can be restored by clicking the red triangle.
                The latest GPS position is indicated by the red airplane icon
                on the map, provided the display contains the lat/lon of the latest GPS
                position.
                <P>NOTE:  This information is suppressed when
                <A HREF="p_options.html">Option</A> <B>Type B</B>
                is checked so as to, in the words of

                    </A>, block the GPS from providing
                false or misleading information.</P>
            <LI>Lower left corner cloud shows the lat/lon position of the center of the
                display, zoom factor and map rotation (see below).  There will also be a
                blue cross in the center if the airplane is not centered in the display.
                The cloud and line will shrink to a blue triangle button when clicked and
                can be restored by clicking the blue triangle.
            <LI>If a course is selected (via <A HREF="p_waypt.html">Waypt1/2</A>,
                <A HREF="p_userwp.html">UserWP</A> GoTo buttons), the course information
                will be shown in the upper right corner cloud in purple along with a purple course
                line.  The cloud may be hidden by clicking on the cloud, shrinking it to
                a purple triangle.  Another click will hide the course line.  A third click
                will restore the cloud and course line.  The course
                can be cleared by long-clicking on the cloud or purple triangle button.
            <LI>Select a chart by clicking the <B>Chart</B> button in
                the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.

                    <LI><B>Auto ENR</B> - selects IFR enroute charts to cover the screen (provided
                        they have already been downloaded).  Any legend information is trimmed
                        from the borders and they are stitched together if necessary.  Note that
                        the scaling of enroute charts varies and so there may be discontinuity
                        of text and line sizes where the charts join.
                    <LI><B>Auto SEC</B> - selects sectional(s) to cover the screen (provided
                        they have already been downloaded).  Any legend information is trimmed
                        from the borders and they are stitched together if necessary.
                    <LI><B>Street</B> - use OpenStreetMap tiles at appropriate zoom level for
                        display.  <I>Requires Internet connection if tiles have not already
                        been displayed on this device.</I>
                    <LI>Chart name in WHITE - chart has not been downloaded.  Selecting the
                        chart will initiate download.  <I>Requires Internet connection.</I>
                    <LI>Chart name in RED - chart has been download but is expired.  Use
                        <A HREF="p_maint.html">maint</A> page to update.

                <P><B>NOTE:</B>  If only a selection for <B>Street</B> appears, it is usually because
                    the device has not received a GPS position report, the GPS position is not in an
                    area covered by the app, or that the database has not been
                    <A HREF="p_maint.html">downloaded</A>.</P>
                <P><B>NOTE:</B>  The primary aviation charts also have a graphic next to the name
                    with a white filled rectangle representing the chart, and the current canvas
                    position represented by a cyan filled rectangle (or dot if the rectangle is too
                    small), and the current position represented by a red dot (if it is within range
                    of the chart).  If the chart is downloaded, a thumbnail will be used in place of
                    the white filled rectangle.</P>
                <P><B>NOTE:</B>  The <B>Auto</B> buttons will prompt to download charts that they
                    need to fill the screen if they are not already downloaded.  The download works
                    only if there is current Internet connectivity.  If you cancel the prompt but
                    later wish to download the charts, either use the
                    <A HREF="p_maint.html">maint</A> page, or reselect the <B>Auto</B> button from
                    the chart menu or select the specific chart you want from the chart menu.</P>

        </UL>
        <P><B>NOTE:</B>  If you manually pan the display, the chart will fix in place and
            will not track movement of the airplane.  The airplane will move but the chart
            will not.  To re-engage tracking, click the Android menu button then
            click <B>Re-center</B>.  The chart will move to maintain the airplane in the
            center of the display, the blue cross will be taken away and the information
            in the lower left corner cloud will be reduced to a minimum.</P>
        <P><B>NOTE:</B>  The app dynamically constructs tiles for zoomed-out levels the first time
            the tiles are needed (to conserve flash space).  Once constructed, they are retrieved
            from flash in the future for faster display.  The delay can particularly be noticed on
            extreme zoom-out levels such as <TT>x 0.2</TT>.  However the charts aren't particularly
            readable at those zoom-outs so they are of little practical use anyway.</P>
        <P>The details of what appears in the lower left corner cloud may vary based
            on the current situation.  At most, lines such as these will appear:</P>
