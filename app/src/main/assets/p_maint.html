        <P>These pages are used to download charts and data.  There are several
            pages to select data from.
        <UL>
            <LI><B>Misc</B> - has the <I>Waypoints</I> database checkbox.  This
                database contains airport, fix, localizer and navaid location
                information for the whole country.  This database is required
                for operation and can not be unloaded.
            <LI><B>Plates</B> - has per-state airport detail information, including
                AFD-like data, approach plates, SIDs, STARs etc.  It fills in the
                information displayed on the <B><A HREF="p_faawp.html">FAAWP</A></B>
                pages.
            <LI><B>ENR</B> - IFR enroute charts
            <LI><B>HEL</B> - helicopter charts
            <LI><B>SEC</B> - sectional charts
            <LI><B>WAC</B> - world charts (Note:  the FAA has stopped updating these)
        </UL>
        <UL>
            <LI>Check the charts/databases you want downloaded to your flash drive
                then click the <I>Download</I> button at the top.  You may click
                checkboxes on more than one page before clikcing <I>Download</I>.
            <LI>You may also click <I>Unload</I> to remove the charts/databases from
                your flash.
        </UL>
        <P>NOTE:  When downloading plates, it will also read OpenStreetMap tiles in the
            background and it may take longer to load the tiles than the database itself.
            These tiles are used for the WairToNow runway diagrams that are useful when
            there is no FAA-supplied airport diagram for a particular airport.  Internet
            connectivity is required for this process to complete, but it is OK if you
            disconnect before it completes as it will start back up automatically when
            you re-connect to the Internet.</P>
