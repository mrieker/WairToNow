                When the current chart expires, the downloaded chart will be used.

        <P>NOTE:  When downloading plates, it will also read
            <A HREF="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</A> tiles in the
            background and it may take longer to load the tiles than the database itself.
            These tiles are used for the WairToNow runway diagrams that are useful when
            there is no FAA-supplied airport diagram for a particular airport.  Internet
            connectivity is required for this process to complete, but it is OK if you
            disconnect before it completes as it will start back up automatically when
            you re-connect to the Internet.</P>
        <P>NOTE:  There is no download button for Street chart data.  The
            <A HREF="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</A>
            tiles are downloaded as needed and so requires access to the Internet.  You
            can preload the tiles by viewing the area ahead of time and WairToNow will
            save those tiles to flash for viewing later.  Be sure to use various zoom
            levels when previewing so those levels will be available when no Internet
            access is available.  The intent of the Street map is for walking or biking
            from an airport to a nearby "$100 hamburger" stand, not for long distances
            as needed for driving.</P>
