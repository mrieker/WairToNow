        <H2>Maint pages</H2>
        <P>These pages are used to download charts and data.  There are several
            pages to select data from.
        <UL>
            <LI><B>Misc</B> - has the <I>Waypoints</I> database checkbox.  This
                database contains airport, fix, localizer and navaid location
                information for the whole country.  This database is required
                for operation and can not be unloaded.
            <LI><B>Plates</B> - has per-state airport detail information, including
                AFD-like data, <A HREF="iap_plate.html">approach plates</A>,
                SIDs, STARs etc.  It fills in the information displayed on the
                <B><A HREF="p_faawp.html">FAAWP</A></B> pages.
            <LI><B>ENR</B> - IFR enroute charts
            <LI><B>HEL</B> - helicopter charts
            <LI><B>SEC</B> - sectional charts
            <LI><B>TAC</B> - terminal area charts
            <LI><B>WAC</B> - world charts (the FAA has stopped updating these)
        </UL>
        <UL>
            <LI>Check the charts/databases you want downloaded to your flash drive
                then click the <I>Download</I> button at the top.  You may click
                checkboxes on more than one page before clicking <I>Download</I>.
                <I>Needless to say, Internet connectivity is required for this
                function.</I>
            <LI>You may also click <I>Unload</I> to remove the selected
                charts/databases from your flash to free up some space.
        </UL>
        <UL>
            <LI>Green text indicates the currently downloaded data is up-to-date and
                will remain so at least for several more days.
            <LI>Yellow text indicates the currently downloaded data is up-to-date but
                will expire in the next few days.
            <LI>Red text indicates the currently downloaded data has expired.
        </UL>
        <P>NOTE:  When downloading plates, it will also read
            <A HREF="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</A> tiles in the
            background and it may take longer to load the tiles than the database itself.
            These tiles are used for the WairToNow runway diagrams that are useful when
            there is no FAA-supplied airport diagram for a particular airport.  Internet
            connectivity is required for this process to complete, but it is OK if you
            disconnect before it completes as it will start back up automatically when
            you re-connect to the Internet.</P>
        <P>NOTE:  There is no download button for Street chart data.  The
            <A HREF="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</A>
            tiles are downloaded as needed and so requires access to the Internet.  You
            can preload the tiles by viewing the area ahead of time and WairToNow will
            save those tiles to flash for viewing later.  Be sure to use various zoom
            levels when previewing so those levels will be available when no Internet
            access is available.  The intent of the Street map is for walking or biking
            from an airport to a nearby "$100 hamburger" stand, not for long distances
            as needed for driving.</P>
