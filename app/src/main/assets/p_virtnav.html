        <H2>VirtNav1 and VirtNav2 pages</H2>
        <P>These pages display dials similar to conventional VOR and ADF dials.  They can be used
            for IFR training <FONT COLOR=RED><I><B>IN VFR CONDITIONS</B></I></FONT> where the
            conventional dials are not available in the aircraft or the beacons are not readily
            available in the area.</P>
        <P>A sample training would be to use a VOR approach plate as an NDB approach when there are
            no NDB approaches available nearby.  You would select the VOR approach's FAF as the
            beacon and then select ADF mode for the display.</P>
        <P>To operate:</P>
        <OL>
            <LI>Either click the yellow [OFF] and enter the waypoint in the dialog or...</LI>
            <LI>Select the beacon to be used on either the FAAWP1, FAAWP2 or UserWP pages.</LI>
            <LI>Select either the VirtNav1 or VirtNav2 page.</LI>
            <LI>Click the FAAWP1, FAAWP2 or UserWP button at the top.</LI>
            <LI>To switch between OFF/VOR/ADF display mode, click the OFF/VOR/ADF mode button in
                the upper-left corner of the display.  The mode does not have to match the beacon
                type, eg, you can use ADF mode even if a VOR is selected.  This is handy for
                practicing NDB approaches using a VOR approach plate <I><B>IN VFR CONDITIONS
                ONLY</B></I>.</LI>
            <LI>Adjust the OBS setting by dragging finger around the numbers on the dial.  The dial
                turns at a ratio of 5-to-1, ie, it takes 5 revolutions of the finger to turn the
                dial a full revolution.</LI>
        </OL>
        <P>The page also has LOC/ILS modes if a localizer or ILS is selected.  For these navaids,
            the OBS setting has no effect as on a real aircraft radio.  ILS mode is selectable only
            when the database indicates there is a glideslope antenna present for that localizer.</P>
        <P>There is also a DME display in the lower left quarter of the display.  By default,
            it is set to the navaid that the needle(s) are using.  To select an alternate
            navaid, click on the numbers and type in the ident of the waypoint you wish to use.
            The dialog box will also allow you to turn the DME off if desired.</P>
        <P>If the Android device is in landscape orientation, the latest selected IAP plate will be
            displayed on the right-hand side of the screen.  This may only be of practical use on a
            larger tablet.</P>
        <P><FONT COLOR=RED><I><B>USE ONLY FOR TRAINING IN VFR CONDITIONS</B></I>, especially when
            using the ILS mode, as the altitude in these GPS receivers is notoriously
            inaccurate, leading to inaccurate glideslope indications!</FONT></P>
        <P>Note:  This page is disabled when <A HREF="p_options.html">Option</A>
            <B>Type B</B> is checked so as to block the GPS from providing false
            or misleading information.</P>
