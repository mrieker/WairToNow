        <H2>VirtNav1 and VirtNav2 pages</H2>
        <P>These pages display dials similar to conventional VOR and ADF dials.  They can be used
            for IFR training <FONT COLOR=RED><I><B>IN VFR CONDITIONS</B></I></FONT> where the
            conventional dials are not available in the aircraft or the beacons are not readily
            available in the area.  They can also be used as backup dials for instrument flight.</P>
        <P>A sample training would be to use a VOR approach plate as an NDB approach when there are
            no NDB approaches available nearby.  You would select the VOR approach's FAF as the
            beacon and then select ADF mode for the display.</P>
        <P><FONT COLOR=RED><I><B>USE ONLY FOR TRAINING IN VFR CONDITIONS</B></I> or as
            <I><B>backup in other instrument flying</B></I>. Be especially wary when
            using the ILS mode, as the altitude in these GPS receivers is notoriously
            inaccurate, leading to inaccurate glideslope indications!</FONT></P>
        <P>NOTE:  This page is disabled when <A HREF="p_options.html">Option</A>
            <B>Type B</B> is checked so as to block the GPS from providing false
            or misleading information.</P>

        <H3>Using the page as a basic VOR dial</H3>

        <OL>
            <LI>Select either the VirtNav1 or VirtNav2 page.</LI>
            <LI>Click on the yellow text at the top.  In the sample, that is where it says
                <B>VOR/DME LWM: LAWRENCE...</B>.  If the screen isn't 'tuned' to anything,
                it will say <B>[OFF]</B> here.</LI>
            <LI>Type the ident of the VOR in the dialog box and click OK.  You can also type the
                ident of any NDB, localizer, airport (icaoid) or intersection in the box as
                well.</LI>
            <LI>The yellow text at the top will indicate what waypoint is being used so you can
                verify that it is using the one you want.</LI>
            <LI>Rotate the OBS dial by dragging your finger around the dial numbers.</LI>
            <LI>By default, the DME window will be tuned to the same waypoint.  To set it to
                something else, click on the DME numbers and enter the desired waypoint in the
                dialog box.  If elevation of the beacon is known, the distance will be slant-range
                indicated by slanted (italic) numbers.  Otherwise, over-the-ground distance will
                be displayed by normal digits.</LI>
            <LI>By default, the dial is put in the mode appropriate to the waypoint selected.  If
                you want to, for example, use an ADF dial to navigate to a VOR navaid, just click
                the mode button in the upper left corner to select ADF mode.</LI>
        </OL>
        <P>Similarly, you can tune in a localizer or ILS.  It will by default set the display to
            LOC or ILS mode, depending on the beacon type.  When the display is in LOC or ILS mode,
            the OBS dial will be locked to the localizer heading.  If you set the display to VOR or
            ADF mode, WairToNow will behave as if there was a VOR or ADF at the same spot as the
            localizer and you can rotate the dial freely.</P>
        <P>When in ILS mode, the dial will calculate what your descent rate should be to stay on
            the glideslope, in feet per minute.  This calculation is based on what the device's GPS
            is showing for the aircraft's ground speed and the glideslope antenna tilt as provided
            in the FAA database.  The indication will appear in the upper right corner of the dial
            window.
            <I>This is advisory only and you must follow your approved navigation system's glideslope
                indications as the final authority.</I>

        <H3>Automatic tuning</H3>
        <P>The VirtNav pages will attempt to automatically tune a navaid used by an approach so you
            don't have to type the identifier in a dialog box.</P>
        <OL>
            <LI>Use the <A HREF="p_faawp.html">FAAWP1 or FAAWP2 page</A> to select the airport and
                approach plate by clicking
                the FAAWP1 or FAAWP2 button at the bottom of the screen and going from there to open
                the approach plate.</LI>
            <LI>Open the VirtNav1 or VirtNav2 page and click the FAAWP1 or FAAWP2 button in the
                upper left corner.  It should tune in the navaid assuming the WairToNow database
                knows what navaid that approach uses.  Verify it is the correct one by looking at
                the yellow text at the top of the screen.</LI>
            <LI>If you rotate the display to landscape mode, the plate will be displayed in the
                right-hand half of the screen.</LI>

        <H3>Automatically stepping through an approach procedure</H3>
        <P>For most approaches, the VirtNav page can step through an approach, automatically turning
            the OBS dial as appropriate.  This is called Coded Istrument Flight Procedure (CIFP) mode.
        <OL>
            <LI>Use the <A HREF="p_faawp.html">FAAWP1 or FAAWP2 page</A> by clicking the FAAWP1 or
                FAAPW2 button at the bottom of the screen to select the airport and
                approach procedure you want to use.</LI>
            <LI>Click the yellow triangle in the lower right corner of the approach plate.  If there
                is no triangle button there, this feature is not available for that approach.  Select
                the starting point (IAF) from the menu given.</LI>
            <LI>Colored dots should appear on the approach plate and a list of steps should appear
                in the lower right corner of the plate.  To get rid of the text, a short click will
                collapse the text to a yellow triangle.  A long click on the text or triangle will
                open a menu giving the option to discontinue the approach or restart it from the
                beginning.</LI>
            <LI>Open either the VirtNav1 or VirtNav2 page, then click the FAAWP1 or FAAWP2 button in
                the upper left corner.</LI>
        </OL>
        <P>The dial should track your progress as you go along.  When you are on the final approach
            course within 3nm of the FAF, it will switch to glideslope mode to guide you down to the
            runway.  Outside of that, it will be in terminal mode with no glideslope provided.</P>
        <P>Once you reach the missed approach point, it will automatically step through the published
            missed approach sequence.  The missed approach sequence is displayed with cyan dots and
            text.</P>
        <P>NOTE:  The OBS dial is locked in place while in CIFP mode, indicating the magnetic course
            for the current segment (depicted in magenta).  The only exception is during the first
            segment of a radar-vector approach, where you can set the vector heading in the OBS dial
            by dragging your finger around the dial.</P>
        <P>NOTE:  If you change the IAF or the plate, you will have to re-tune the VirtNav dial to
            use the new CIFP.  Just re-click the FAAWP1 or FAAPW2 button in the upper left corner and
            it will start tracking the new steps.</P>
